The most common injury is a sprain, which is an injury to a ligament. Ligaments are bands of tissue that connect bones to each other and help stabilize joints. A sprain occurs when a ligament is stretched or torn due to sudden twisting, bending, or force applied to the joint. Sprains can range from mild to severe, depending on the degree of damage to the ligament. The most commonly sprained joints are the ankle, wrist, and knee.

What is the difference between a strain and a sprain?

A strain is an injury to a muscle or tendon, while a sprain is an injury to a ligament. Muscles are responsible for producing force and movement, while tendons connect muscles to bones.
