Some weights of LlamaForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

/home/thsch026/my-envs/kdein/lib/python3.10/site-packages/datasets/load.py:759: FutureWarning: The repository for accuracy contains custom code which must be executed to correctly load the metric. You can inspect the repository content at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/datasets/2.19.1/metrics/accuracy/accuracy.py
You can avoid this message in future by passing the argument `trust_remote_code=True`.
Passing `trust_remote_code=True` will be mandatory to load this metric from the next major release of `datasets`.
