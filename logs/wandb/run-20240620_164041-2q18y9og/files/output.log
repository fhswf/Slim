{'question': 'do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident', 'labels': 1, 'passage': "Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.", 'input_ids': [128000, 3055, 1695, 10167, 277, 13145, 7016, 6144, 1884, 889, 1520, 520, 459, 11677, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001, 128001], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
