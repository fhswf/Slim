Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
Some weights of LlamaForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /home/thsch026/masterarbeit/models/llama3/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-HF and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
